						<h3 class="heading-small">Hypothesis</h3>
						<p>
							If we make the Management Information details available and easy to read,<br />
							then advisers, team leaders and performance staff can easily view the current status of the service,<br />
							because having this information visible and easy to read will enable all staff to monitor performance
						</p>
						<p>
							If we change the naming of parts of the service,<br />
							then we will ensure commonality and consistency across the service,<br />
							because having different names/titles for the same entity causes confusion
						</p>


						<h3 class="heading-small">Changes</h3>
						<p>
							Added in the MI banner to Adviser view, team leader view, regional and national views
						</p>
						<p>
							Renaming of teams to specialisms, renaming Brought Forwrad (BF) to Next Action Date
						</p>

						<h3 class="heading-small">Research notes</h3>
						<p>
							User testing session in Harrow and regular testing with the SME's
						</p>
						<p>
							New proposition namings have been received well by staff in testing
						</p>
						<p>
							Further work to complete on the content of views and screens,  full content review suggested
						</p>
